Used for temperature monitoring, vehicle attitude monitoring including roll pitch yaw, and vehicle altitude monitoring.
In this project I used ESP32 for the microcontroller, BMP380 for barometer reading, MPU9250 for vehicle attitude reading for example gyro x, y, z and accel x, y, z
## ESP32
I wanted to use Teensy 4.0 but I'm not familiar with Teensy 4.0, at that time I had little research time so I chose to use ESP 32. Actually, ESP32 is enough to be used as a microcontroller in this project. The ESP32 has 240MHz processor speed, 4 x SPI, 2 x I2C, 3 x UART. Not too bad compared to Teensy 4.0 which has a 600Mhz processor speed, 7 x UART, 3 x I2C, 3 x SPI.
